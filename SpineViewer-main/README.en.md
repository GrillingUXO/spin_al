## Installation

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/ww-rm/SpineViewer/releases) page and download the ZIP.  
2. Make sure you have the [.NET Desktop Runtime 8.0.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) installed.  
3. Alternatively, download the `SelfContained` ZIP, which runs standalone without any .NET prerequisites.  
4. To export GIF or other video formats, install the `ffmpeg` CLI and add it to your PATH.  
   - Windows builds: see the [FFmpeg download page](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows)  
   - Direct download: [ffmpeg-release-full.7z](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-full.7z)

## Usage

### Importing Skeletons

You can import Spine skeletons in three ways:

- Drag & drop or paste skeleton files or folders onto the model list.  
- Use **File > Open** to batch‚Äëopen multiple skeleton files.  
- Use **File > Open Single Model** to open one at a time.

### Adjusting Content

- Right‚Äëclick menu and keyboard shortcuts are available in the model list. You can multi‚Äëselect to adjust parameters in batch.  
- In the preview pane, you can also use mouse controls:
  - **Left‚Äëclick & drag** to move a model; hold **Ctrl** to multi‚Äëselect (synced with the list).  
  - **Right‚Äëclick & drag** to pan the entire scene.  
  - **Mouse wheel** to zoom; hold **Ctrl** to zoom all selected models proportionally.  
  - **‚ÄúRender Selected Only‚Äù** mode shows only the selected models in preview; use the list to change selection.

Below the preview, playback controls let you scrub through the timeline like a basic player.

### Exporting Content

Exports follow the ‚Äúwhat you see is what you get‚Äù principle‚Äîyour real‚Äëtime preview is exactly what gets exported.

Key export options:

- **Render Selected Only**: includes only the selected models in both preview and export.  
- **Output Folder**: if unspecified, exports go into each model‚Äôs source folder; otherwise, everything exports to the chosen folder.  
- **Export Single**: by default, each model is exported separately; enable this to render all selected models together into a single output.  
- **Auto Resolution**: ignores preview resolution and viewport size‚Äîexports at the content‚Äôs actual bounds; for animations, matches the full animation area.
